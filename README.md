## pollen-tuftorial

Pollen tutorial based on Tufte CSS

## Project status

I started this with the idea of turning it into a new & whizzy [Pollen](https://github.com/mbutterick/pollen) tutorial. I got far enough to convince myself that it would work well for that. (And also that Pollen makes `tufte-css` a lot easier to use.) But critically, I didn’t come up with a justification to spend another big chunk of my time working for free. If you like `pollen` and `tufte-css`, you are welcome to pick up the project from here, as I won’t be taking it further.
